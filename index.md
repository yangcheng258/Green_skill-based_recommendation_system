### Standalone Plotly HTML Files

These links open a new page that contains *only* the Plotly chart.
The source HTML files for these are located in `assets/plotly_output/`.

* [Green Plotly (Standalone)](/assets/plotly_output/GreenSkillSpace_cluster_plot_highlight.html)
* [Plotly2 Random Plot (Standalone)](/assets/plotly_output/my_interactive_plot.html)


### Plotly Charts Embedded in Webpages

These links take you to dedicated pages (source Markdown in `_pages/`) where the Plotly charts are embedded within the page content.
[Plotly ](/pages/plotly.md). **This is how you show the HTML interactive directly.**
[Plotly2 Random plot](/pages/plotly2.md). **This is how you actually embed the interactive map in a webpage.**
